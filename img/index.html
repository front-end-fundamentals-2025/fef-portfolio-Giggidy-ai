      Background A little preface to knowing me is summarised in this section
      and attached is a contact page so as to get intouch incase of follow ups.
      I am a relatively new student in this space. This index html carries the
      code for my online portfolio with a picture of me from 5yrs ago to get
      familiar with my appearance.
